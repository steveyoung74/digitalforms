                    <p>We will grant your rights request only to the extent that, following an assessment of your request, we are allowed and required to do so under data protection law. Your rights may be limited; for example, if fulfilling your request would unfairly reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law or have a compelling legitimate interest to keep.</p>

                        <li>in certain cases, ask us to restrict or suppress further use of your personal information.

                        <li>object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
                        <li>have the personal information we hold about you erased in certain circumstances, unless it prevents us from carrying out the services you have requested or prevents us from meeting our legal obligations.</li>
                        <li>obtain and reuse your personal information for your own purposes across different organisations; for example, if you wish to move to a new financial services provider. This enables you to move, copy or transfer your personal information easily between our IT systems and another provider's safely and securely (where technically feasible), without affecting its usability.</li>
                        <li>lodge a complaint about how we collect, process and store your personal information with our Data Protection Officer (details below), or with the supervisory authority: Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF.</li>
